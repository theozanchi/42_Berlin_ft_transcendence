1. Nginx receives the request: 
When a client sends an HTTP request, it first reaches the Nginx server.

2. Nginx routes the request: 
Nginx examines the URL path of the request and determines which backend service should handle it based on the configuration in its nginx.conf file. For example, if the request URL matches a location block configured to proxy_pass to the game_config service, Nginx forwards the request to that service.

3. Gunicorn serves the Django application: 
Once Nginx has determined the appropriate backend service, it forwards the request to that service. In our case, since we're using Django applications, Nginx forwards the request to Gunicorn, which is serving the Django application within the game_config or game_logic container.

4. Gunicorn forwards the request to Django: 
Gunicorn receives the request from Nginx and passes it to the Django application running within the container. The Django application then processes the request, executes the corresponding view function, interacts with the database if needed, and generates an HTTP response.

5. Django sends the response back to Gunicorn: 
Once the Django application has generated the response, it sends it back to Gunicorn.

6. Gunicorn sends the response back to Nginx: 
Gunicorn forwards the response back to Nginx.

7. Nginx sends the response to the client: 
Finally, Nginx forwards the response back to the client that originally made the request.
